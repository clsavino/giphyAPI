# giphyAPI
Used AJAX to get gifs from the giphy API. Used jQuery to dynamically add buttons and gifs for each NBA player in the array to the DOM. Made use of the $(document).on('click', filter , function) call to add functionality to the dynamically generated buttons and divs like displaying the gifs and changing the state from still to animate and back again to still.
